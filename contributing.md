How can I contribute?

1. Reporting Bugs
- Please be aware, that the provided software is not developed or maintained by me. Should there be any bugs when using this method check the documentation for both ddrc-sim and xMing first. You can still create a Issue report to help other people experiencing the same bug.

2. Suggesting Enhancements
- If someone finds a better way of doing this he/she can suggest a enhancement below the issue section. I will test if it works and if yes, will add it to the main branch. Should I find it doesn't work for me I will group it under the experimental branch.
